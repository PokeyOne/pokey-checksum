# TCP Checksum Calculator

This is a simple library for my own education on the calculation of a TCP checksum
in Rust. I do not intend to update this library extensively because Rust already
has a Standard Library implementation of TCP communication, but you are free to
use this code as described in the MIT or Apache license.

## Using

Include the following line in your `Cargo.toml` file.
```toml
pokey_checksum = "0.1.0"
```

## Documentation

Run the following command to show the documentation.
```sh
cargo doc --open
```
